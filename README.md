# Important!

**This project was a learning exercise during my time at Thinkful and does not represent my own work and is not a good representation of my skills.  It's visible only because I forked this repo instead of cloning it and as such I cannot make it private.**

```bash
git checkout 1-homepage
```

### 2. Poem Page

This branch adds a dynamic route for the poem page

```bash
git checkout 2-poempage

### 3. Link Instances

```bash
git checkout 3-link-instances
